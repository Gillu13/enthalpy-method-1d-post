# Enthalpy-method-1d-post 

I devoted a [blog post](https://www.gasciences.com/post/solve-real-life-pdes-with-linear-algebra-in-c) to an example of usage of C++ in order to solve a real-life partial differential equations system with linear algebra. More specifically that solidification of a liquid sphere using the enthalpy method.

This repository is where you can find the code I used for that purpose.
